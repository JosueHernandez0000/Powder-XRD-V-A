## Overview

This repository packs more than **1 000 lines of python code** into a standalone executable for analyzing powder X-ray Diffraction (XRD) data. The program focuses on visualization of the experimental data, peak identification and deconvolution of overlapping peaks. The code supports multi-peak fitting using Pseudo-Voigt functions to handle overlapping peaks and perform automated peak characterization.

For questions, feature requests, bug reports, or collaboration opportunities, please contact the [**developer**](https://github.com/JosueHernandez0000). If you found this automated XRD data analysis tool helpful, you can show your support by: [**Buying me a coffee!**](https://buymeacoffee.com/josue.hernandez) Every coffee helps me stay awake to keep improving the tool, adding new features, and providing you with even better analysis capabilities.

## 2. Functionality
1. **Plots XRD data**: Plots experimental data, must be in .xy format.
2. **Removes background if needed**: Automatically detects background and lets the user decide whether to remove background or not
3. **Plots XRD with selected reference patterns**: Plots a selected reference pattern in the same plot as the sample XRD for a quick comparison. 
4. **Peak identification**: Automatically detects main peaks in the diffractogram.
5. **Peak deconvolution**: Performs a peak deconvolution around each major peak to identify any overlapping peaks.
6. **FWHM calculation**: Calculates the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of each epak in the diffractogram.

## 3. Main Outputs
This tool is meant to be a quick and easy way to plot and visualize experimental XRD data. The main outputs of the program are the following plots:
1. **XRD spectra with background**
2. **XRD spectra without background**
3. **Plots XRD with selected reference patterns**
4. **All peaks in the diffractogram**
5. **All peak deconvolutions**: The plots show the multi pseudo voigt fit/deconvolution with FWHM of the peaks

## 4. How to Use
Follow these steps to use the software:
1. **Clone the repository to your machine**
2. **Make sure the following folder structure is followed**:
```
Powder XRD VA 1.0.0/
â”œâ”€â”€ reference_patterns/  
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ reference_patterns.xlsx   # Stores the crystallographic information of the reference patterns             
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ plots/                        # Stores the generated plots
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ deconvolution_plots/            
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ peak_plots/ 
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ reference_plots/          
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ XRD_plots/
|
â”œâ”€â”€ raw_xy_data/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ your_data.xy       # XRD data to be analyzed
|
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md             # Documentation for the project.
â”œâ”€â”€ LICENSE     
â””â”€â”€ Powder_XRD_VA.exe      # Standalone .exe file
```

3. **Run the `.exe` file**
4. **Open the plots in the plots folder**


## 5. Technical Details
### Reference patterns 
- The crystallographic information (peak position, peak intensity and miller indices) of the current reference patterns is stored in `reference_patterns.xlsx`. Information was obtained from the Crystallographic Open Database. You can add more reference patterns by simply:
   - Create a new sheet in the Excel file
   - Rename the sheet to match the name of your reference patterns
   - Fill in the Excel sheet with the crystallographic information (please follow the same structure and column names as in the current file). 
- Not following these instructions to add a new reference pattern will crash the program.

### Peak Detection
- Starting from version 1.0.3 the program lets the user specify the number of sections/windows to divide the diffractogram and specify the `sensisitivity` of each window.
- Lower values of sensitivity (0.3) = More peaks are detected within a window
- Higher values of sensitivity (1.5) = Fewer peaks are detected within a window
- Suggestion: Start with window = 1 and sensisitivity = 1

### Profile Fitting and peak deconvolution
- Fitting is performed using:
    - **Pseudo-Voigt Model:** Combination of Lorentzian and Gaussian profiles.
    - **baseline correction:** If the baseline is not zero, the baseline is adjusted based on the local noise level.
    - Peaks are iteratively fitted, with RÂ² optimization to ensure the best-fit parameters.


## 6. Limitations and Areas for Improvement

### Current Limitations
- Peak deconvolution may fail if data is too noisy or peak is too close to the noise level (usually the case in low intensity peaks)
- Handling closely spaced peaks (less than instrument resolution) can be challenging.
- Limited support for asymmetric or skewed peaks outside of Pseudo-Voigt modeling.
- Fixed axis from 10 to 90 degrees.
- Only supports `.xy` files. 


### Potential Enhancements
The following features may come in a future release:
- Let the user fine-tune parameters of the analysis
- Dynamically detect scan range and scale axis accordingly
- Support `.csv` files
